Monolith is intended as an exercise in refactoring existing code to a Microservice 
architecture. 

The best starting point to illustrate what Monolith does is com.xebia.msa.rest.ScenarioTest.
This class shows how the REST services offered by Monolith can be used to create a web account,
fill a shopping basket and complete an order. 

Monolith is part of Xebia's micro-a Github project.
